README for Automated Pedestrian Traffic Signal System
Description:
This project introduces an automated pedestrian traffic signal system aimed at enhancing pedestrian safety and accessibility. The system replaces the traditional button-pressing mechanism with a fully automated process that prioritizes People of Determination and improves crossing experiences for all users. By integrating components like RFID sensors, ultrasonic sensors, servo motors, LEDs, buzzers, and an LCD display, the system ensures safe and efficient traffic management while addressing the limitations of conventional methods.

Key features include:

RFID priority for People of Determination to provide extended crossing time.
Ultrasonic sensor detection for regular pedestrians.
LED traffic lights and servo-controlled barricades for effective pedestrian and vehicle management.
Audible and visual alerts through buzzers and LCD messages for accessibility.

Components Used:
Arduino Uno: Central microcontroller for processing and controlling the system.
RFID Module: Prioritizes People of Determination.
Ultrasonic Sensor: Detects pedestrian presence.
Servo Motor: Operates the barricade.
LEDs and Buzzer: Provide visual and auditory signals.
LCD Display: Displays messages like "Stop," "Wait," and "Cross."

How to Use:
Connect the hardware components as per the wiring diagram.
Upload the Arduino code provided in this repository to the Arduino Uno.
Place RFID tags near the sensor for priority access.
Observe the dynamic traffic light control, barricade movement, and visual/audio feedback.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how automation and prioritization can make pedestrian crossings safer and more inclusive. By integrating accessible features and dynamic signal control, it bridges the gap between traditional systems and modern traffic management.
